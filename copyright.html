                       ACM COPYRIGHT PROCEDURES
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ACM Policy on Copyright Ownership
  It is the policy of ACM to own the copyrights on its technical public-
  ations to protect the interests of ACM, its authors and their employ-
  ers, and at the same time to facilitate the appropriate reuse of this
  material by others.
 
Written Signatures Required by Law
  United States Copyright Law requires that the transfer of copyright of
  each contribution from the author to ACM be confirmed in writing.  It
  is necessary, therefore, that authors print, complete, and sign (in
  either Section A or B) the attached copyright form and return it along
  with their manuscript to the address shown in Section C of the form.
 
Authorization to Transfer Copyright
  If you're employed and you prepared your paper as a part of your job,
  the rights to your paper may initially rest with your employer.  In
  that case, when you sign the copyright transfer form, ACM assumes that
  you're authorized to do so by your employer.  If not, the form should
  be signed by someone so authorized.

Jointly Authored Papers
  For jointly authored papers, an original signature is required from
  from the first-named (assumed senior) author only.  However, ACM
  assumes that all authors have been advised and have consented to the
  terms of this form.
 
Government Authors
  Authors who are U. S. Government employees and/or whose papers are not
  copyrightable as part of certain Government contract work are not re-
  quired to sign Section A, but any coauthors outside the government
  contract are.
 
  Section B of the form is to be used instead of Section A only if all
  authors are U. S. Government employees and have prepared the paper as
  part of their job, or if the work is an uncopyrightable product of a
  Government contract.
 
Retained Author Rights
  ACM authors have all of the rights scientific authors have historical-
  ly enjoyed, including the right to present orally the submitted or
  similar material in any form; the right to make minor reuse, with
  credit, in publications, and major reuse in works of the author's own
  with notice and credit to ACM; the right to republish, with notice and
  credit to ACM, in works published by the employer or for the employ-
  er's internal purposes; the right to reproduce for peer review in
  reasonable quantities; and all proprietary rights other than copy-
  right.
 
Republication  Permissions
  Although it is not part of ACM's policy to grant authors or their
  organizations the sole right to approve permissions for republishing
  by third parties, ACM always seeks the approval of its authors in
  weighing such requests.  For jointly authored papers, approval will
  be sought from the first-named (assumed senior) author only.  This is
  done as a matter of professional courtesy.
