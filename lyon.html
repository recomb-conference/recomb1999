<H2>Lyon </H2>

<P>Capital of the Gauls, Renaissance trading center, Mecca
of the silk industry and birth place of cinema, during its 2000-year history
Lyon has founded its development and influence on intense economic, commercial
and cultural activity. </P>

<P>To lovers of the finer things in life, Lyon offers its
prestigious heritage, along with an easy access to the Alpine slopes and
the Mediterranean sun. </P>

<H4><I>A vibrant economy </I></H4>

<P>An undisputed center of scientific and technological excellence,
the Lyon metropolitan area is the richest and most dynamic economic capital
in France after the Paris area. </P>

<P>Chemicals, textiles, mechanics, state-of-the-art technology...
the flagship sectors of Lyon's economy have their roots in a dense industrial
history. And each day, companies and their managers demonstrate their ability
to innovate in the global marketplace. </P>

<P>The chemical and pharmaceutical industries may have had
humble beginnings as dyeing workshops, late in the last century, but today
their products and materials are in demand across the globe. Companies
such as <I>Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc</I>, <I>M&eacute;rieux</I> and <I>Boiron</I>
make Lyon a European healthcare center of the first rank. </P>

<H4><I>Lyon: a captivating city </I></H4>

<P>The people of Lyon are deeply attached to their city,
and quite naturally enjoy sharing its attractions with visiting guests.
</P>

<P>They love the pleasures of dining and will drag their
guests off, a shade mischievously, to the famous <I>bouchon</I>s, the cozy
restaurants whose family atmosphere encourages endless discussion, fueled
by the region's finest culinary specialities. You will sample the most
renowed specialities. Among the main dishes: pork chitterlings, fried tripe
in brezad crumbs, pike dumplings, sheep's feet... On the sweet side: thin
beignets, <I>cushion</I> and <I>cocoon</I> chocolates... The wines include
delicious vintages from the prestigious vineyards of neighboring Burgundy,
the C&ocirc;tes du Rh&ocirc;ne and the Beaujolais. Tastebuds at the ready
! </P>

<P>The city itself is an invitation to stroll and wander.
You will amble across squares, along river banks, through the Gardens of
<I>Fourvi&egrave;re</I> or the sumptuous <I>T&ecirc;te d'Or</I> Park. You
will fall for its delicate hues, the pinks and ochres of the <I>Croix-Rousse
</I>and the banks of the Sa&ocirc;ne, the rivers blues and browns, all
made richer and deeper by the night-time illuminations. Feel the city's
pulse throb in the market on the <I>Quai Saint-Antoine</I>, and the Craft
Market. In the luxury downtown boutiques, in craftsmen's workshops in Saint-Jean,
and in antique dealers' shops on the <I>Rue Auguste Comte</I>. When evening
falls, the show will go on long after the audiences have gone home. Night
and day, Lyon's heart beats for you. </P>
